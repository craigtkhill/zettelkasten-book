# YAML Frontmatter

The first thing you need to know about `zrt` is that it uses yaml frontmatter to organize metadata about your notes.

Your YAML frontmatter should look like this and be placed at the very top of the file.

```markdown
---
tags:
  - refactored
  - blogged
---
```

*Note* The `refactored` tag lets me know that this note has already been processed and the `blogged` tag informs me that I have shared this note.

The tags you use are completely flexible. You can tag however you see fit.
