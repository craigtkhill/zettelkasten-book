## **Why Write this Blog?: Documenting My Continuous Learning Journey**

With AI increasingly driving content creation, projections suggest that by 2025, 90% of what we read online will be machine-written _([1](https://petapixel.com/2023/01/17/90-of-online-content-could-be-generated-by-ai-by-2025-expert-says/))_. This raises concerns. For instance, if AI starts predominantly consuming its output, then the quality and depth of subsequently generated content will decline _([2](https://venturebeat.com/ai/the-ai-feedback-loop-researchers-warn-of-model-collapse-as-ai-trains-on-ai-generated-content/))_. We can think of this as a model sustaining itself by eating its own ðŸ’©.

Against this backdrop, sharing our narratives online takes on heightened importance. No algorithm, however sophisticated, can mirror the insights and the aha moments punctuating real people's lives.

So that's why I'm writing this blog. To share my thoughts, learnings and evolving understanding of subjects I am deeply passionate about.

Each blog entry is a stepping stone, mapping my growth and guiding me closer to my overarching ambitions. Over time, I plan to connect these learnings to pave the way to my larger aspirationsâ€”landing my dream job or launching a thriving business.

To keep revising my understanding, I'll revisit past blogs, infusing them with fresh insights so that each entry is a living document that evolves with time, updating them with new insights so that every post is dynamic and mirrors my evolving perspective.

Over the following months and years, I promise stories of challenges, realizations and the sheer joy of understanding something new. As I etch my path, one blog at a time, I hope to find my voice and share a unique perspective. As AI-generated content edges toward becoming a mere commodity, only our human narratives stand to remain irreplaceable and invaluable.
