# Limitations are good
If you find yourself using AI to fix every problem, it can be difficult to wean yourself off. You need immense coding skills you set yourself apart from AI, and you won't learn those relying on AI.

At first, it can feel like you are moving at a glacial pace. Using AI gets you there quickly, but you need to slow down to really learn something. To let the thoughts marinate in your brain and take root, you need to go slow so that you can go fast later.

Start projects where there is no rush, no expectations, build those skills slowly, and limit your AI use.

*Here are some ideas for limiting your AI use.*
1. Restrict yourself to basic plans.
2. Devote half your time to thinking without AI.
3. Ban yourself from copy/pasting code.
4. Read the documentation first to understand how a library works.
5. Develop your tools and use them.
