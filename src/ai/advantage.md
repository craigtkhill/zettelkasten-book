# Advantage in an AI world
If you just know how to use the models that everyone uses or the tools that everyone uses, then you will be a commodity.

AI cannot do the really interesting stuff, which is solving really hard problems that involve understanding whole systems, and AI cannot understand the larger context of lots of decisions.

However, AI can guide decisions in systems, and that makes them powerful.

AI makes predictions, and predictions are a key input into decisions. But we also need judgment and data. And as humans, we can bring that all together.

It will be our own individual human-driven systems, and I think systems that are opinionated, consistent, and deterministic, that will work better for true applications of AI. Systems enable defensibility and can scale. Systems are hard to copy because they are complex. And in an AI world, our superpower might be to build our systems that use AI to augment our decisions and allow us to do things that only we as individuals can do.

In other words, it's the applications built on top of AI that will be what separates the leaders from the pack.
