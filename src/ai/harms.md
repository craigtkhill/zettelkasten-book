AI has some benefits. However, by my count, its harms are significantly more numerous.

## Amplifies the Dunning-Kruger Effect
The Dunning-Kruger effect is a cognitive bias where people with limited knowledge or skill in a particular area tend to overestimate their competence in that domain. Thanks to AI, it is now possible to write entire reports and documents on topics you know nothing about. Just look at Curls' problem with [AI-generated slop security reports](https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/07/curl_ai_bug_reports/). Now, it's easier than ever to be bad at something while simultaneously thinking you're great and without doing the hard work to get better, you'll never improve.

## AI is an Existential Risk
The [AI Risk Repository](https://airisk.mit.edu/) lists over 1600 potential risks that advanced AI systems could pose. AI has quietly ignited an arms race between nation-states for dominance. All of the world's leaders will have to go along for a very long time without acting stupidly to prevent the fall of humanity (probably of which is; unlikely). AI has already transformed the battlefield of Ukraine, making whole classes of equipment like naval ships obsolete and others like tanks less effective, resulting in a stalemate [^1]. In a total war, the use of AI to gain a battlefield advantage is always on the table, even with the catastrophic risks. Nuclear weapons had the advantage of mutually assured destruction. With AI, humans in their fight for survival will escalate its use, unleashing more potent killing machines until their last stand. I'm not saying we end up with a Terminator-like scenario, but the realistic scenario of constant attack from 1000s of aerial drones and machine gun-toting robodogs is highly likely. If we do not achieve world peace soon, our stupidity will lead us to make AI that destroys the world.
