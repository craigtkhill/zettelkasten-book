Here are some uses of AI

# Socratic Method
Use AI to ask you questions to get you thinking.
Use AI to ask you questions about what you are not thinking about.
AI is great for this to help you clarify your ideas.
The opportunity of using AI to make breakthroughs in many fields, including mathematics, will be simply helping you identify ideas you were unaware of and apply it to your problem.

# Good Enough Search
AI is useful when you have no clue how to do something and want to get to an answer quickly.
But it is useless at finding optimal answers.
If you are pressed for time and you don't care enough about an answer to invest more time into it then AI is certainly better than traditional web search or following your gut.
If it is something more serious then you will need to check your answers.
