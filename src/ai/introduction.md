I've been having a lot of thoughts about AI lately. These thoughts on how we are using AI revolve around a singular point. Sure, developers are losing their precision, creativity, autonomy, but most severely, coding became not fun.

There was a branching point at which using AI to help code stopped being fun. This was around the time that developers started trading Copilot's basic line completion for more cursor-style vibe coding IDEs.

I notice that as LLMs take bigger and bigger steps, the quality of their output declines. Sure, they might do fantastically on benchmarks, but their benchmarks do not match my real-world use case. So I can't rely on their APIs for a stable workflow. I'm not saying we should stop using AI for development. But we should stop relying on it. I don't want AI tools that write all the code. I want tools to write the code the way I want to write it.
## REQUIREMENTS
- I want a pair programmer who can make me better.
- A human plus AI working more rapidly with fast iteration cycles will work way better than a human plus AI working slowly in big steps.
- I want to get into a flow state again.
- Conversely, I want to slow down and think through each step, to write robust code from the start that won't require tons of refactoring later.
- I want to know everything that is written and how it works.
- A pair programmer who doesn't write the code, but checks it.
- Instead of having to code review big error-prone walls of code, I want to review one line at a time, and update those lines in real time.
- What little code it might suggest, I want to learn from it.
- I want to decide how everything hangs together, to architect the system.

As far as I can tell in my research, no one else is implementing AI to meet these requirements. Maybe that's for good reason. However, the direction we are collectively heading has become so painful that I find myself in desperate need to trying something different. Maybe it will be a complete failure, but I will learn immensely from any attempt to validate my approach.

This project is a high priority for me. It may be the tool that helps me build all my other tools. The goal is to make programming fun again, and who knows, maybe it will give me an advantage in reducing the amount of slop I need to clean up. Maybe there is a reason everyone is going in the same direction. However, it's not working for me.
