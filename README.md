# Craig Hill's Zettelkasten Book

## 🌱 About
A personal blog exploring ideas that emerge from connections made within my zettelkasten - a knowledge management system that helps connect disparate ideas and foster deep thinking. Rather than traditional chronological blogging, content here grows organically from the connections and patterns that emerge from my notes and experiences.
